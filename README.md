# breast-cancer-classification
For the DataFlair breast cancer classification project: https://data-flair.training/blogs/project-in-python-breast-cancer-classification/

Objective: To build a breast cancer classifier on an IDC dataset that can accurately classify a histology image as benign or malignant. Train on 80% of the dataset and keep 10% for validation.

Dataset: IDC_regular dataset (the breast cancer histology image dataset) from Kaggle. This dataset holds 2,77,524 patches of size 50Ã—50 extracted from 162 whole mount slide images of breast cancer specimens scanned at 40x. Of these, 1,98,738 test negative and 78,786 test positive with IDC.
